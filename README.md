This is a task manager which the user first must log in. In order to log in you must type "admin" for both the username and password. Then the user is taken to the task manager, where they are given three options at the bottom, add task, edit task, and delete task. The user first must add a task and they will be given the option to give the task a name, a description, task priorety, and a due date, if a user enter in something blank for the task name, description, or date it will give an error saying they must not leave these fields empty. Once they add the task, they can edit it, being able to change the name, description, priorety, or date. They can also delete the task. A txt file will generate with all the tasks the user put in and will change with any edits or deletion.
